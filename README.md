## Know your enemy
The Colorado potato beetle is known for its ability to develop resistance to many insecticides, making it one of the most difficult garden pests to eliminate.
Both the adult and larval forms eat the leaves and can completely defoliate an entire plant and in some cases even cause the death of the crop. 
The Colorado potato beetle can also infest other plants in the garden, such as tomatoes, peppers and aubergines.
